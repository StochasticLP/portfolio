# Trajectory Optimization

Trajectory Optimization involves computing a complete path (state and control trajectory) from a start to a goal state that minimizes some cost.

## Planning

Instead of a reactive controller like PID or LQR, Traj-Opt plans the entire motion in advance. This allows for complex maneuvers like the swing-up.
