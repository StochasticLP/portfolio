# Introduction to Drake Simulation

Welcome to the interactive Drake simulation tutorial. In this series, we will explore different control strategies for a cart-pole system.

## The System

The cart-pole is a classic control problem where a pole is attached to a cart moving along a track. The goal is usually to swing the pole up and balance it.

## Manual Control

In this first step, you can try to control the cart-pole manually. Use the **Arrow Keys** (Left/Right) to apply force to the cart.

Try to swing the pole up! It's harder than it looks.
