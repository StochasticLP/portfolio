# PID Control

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is a common feedback loop component in industrial control systems.

## How it works

The controller calculates an "error" value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint.

In this simulation, we use a PID controller to stabilize the cart position, but balancing the pole requires more advanced techniques or careful tuning.
