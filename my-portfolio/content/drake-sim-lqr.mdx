# LQR Control

Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is an optimal control strategy.

## Optimality

LQR finds a control law that minimizes a cost function, typically balancing performance (minimizing error) and effort (minimizing control input).

For the cart-pole, LQR is excellent at balancing the pole once it is near the upright position.
