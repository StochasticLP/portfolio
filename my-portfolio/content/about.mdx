    I'm Luke Phillips, an aspiring robotics researcher driven by a fascination with
    creating machines that navigate the world with the fluid intelligence
    of living systems. My path to robotics has been anything but
    linear—it's been shaped by years of exploring physics, mathematics,
    and artificial intelligence, by hands-on engineering work that taught
    me the gap between theory and implementation, and by a growing
    conviction that the most meaningful work I could do lies at the
    intersection of perception, learning, and control. What ultimately
    drew me to this field wasn't a single moment of clarity but rather a
    gradual recognition that robotics synthesizes everything I find
    compelling about science and engineering: control theory, physics, artificial intelligence, and the tangible challenge of building systems that work in the messy complexity of the real world.

My academic foundation began at the University of Utah, where I
graduated in May 2024 with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics
and Applied Mathematics, along with a minor in Computer Science. I chose
 to study data science initially, however I soon switched to physics because
I found it much more fun and interesting. The
computational emphasis in my physics degree and my parallel study of
applied mathematics gave me a strong foundation in scientific computing,
numerical methods, differential equations, and the mathematical tools
essential for modeling complex systems. Courses like Computing in
Physics, Numerical Analysis, and Data Management for Machine Learning
taught me not just the theory but the practical implementation skills
necessary to translate mathematical concepts into working code. I learned
to build physics simulations from first principles, implement numerical
optimization algorithms, and work with large-scale scientific
datasets—skills that would prove essential for robotics research.


Throughout my undergraduate years, I had a tendency to follow my
curiosity wherever it led, which meant I explored a wide range of
research areas before finding my focus. I worked with Dr. Kyle Dawson on
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument project, analyzing massive
spectral datasets to identify classification disagreements between DESI
data and earlier cosmological surveys. This work taught me how to
handle large-scale scientific computing, using Python libraries like
Pandas and working with supercomputing resources through the Department
of Energy's NERSC facility. I learned the importance of rigorous data
analysis and the challenge of extracting meaningful signals from noisy,
high-dimensional data—skills that translate directly to robotics
perception problems. In another project, I developed a convolutional
neural network to predict the mechanical properties of porous materials
from cross-sectional images, generating training data through finite
element analysis and implementing the complete pipeline from data
generation to model training. This gave me hands-on experience with deep
learning architectures and the practical challenges of training neural
networks on synthetic data, an approach that's become increasingly
important in robotics as researchers look for ways to generate training
data through simulation.

But some of my most formative experiences came from engineering work
outside the classroom. As Avionics Team Lead for the university's
CubeSat Club, I led a team that built a functional telemetry ground
station with tracking capabilities for UHF satellite communication. We
integrated Arduino-controlled motors with signal analysis software to
create a system that could autonomously track satellites as they passed
overhead. This project taught me the crucial difference between
theoretical understanding and practical implementation—you can know all
the communication theory in the world, but until you've debugged
hardware integration issues at three in the morning, soldered together
antenna feeds, and figured out why your tracking algorithm is
introducing a systematic pointing error, you don't really understand the
system. In the university Aerospace Club, I developed a MATLAB
trajectory integration program that incorporated thrust profiles, weather
data, and aerodynamics to predict rocket landing points. These projects
gave me experience with the full stack of robotics-adjacent engineering:
sensor integration, real-time control systems, trajectory optimization,
and the unglamorous but essential work of making physical systems
reliable.

During my time at Utah, I also completed several projects that
demonstrated my ability to work across the theoretical and practical
divide. In Computing in Physics II, I built a complete physics
simulation of Feynman's ratchet and pawl thought experiment from
scratch, implementing the full thermodynamic model and creating
animations that conclusively showed that work cannot be extracted when
both chambers are at the same temperature. The project required deep
understanding of statistical mechanics, careful numerical implementation
to avoid introducing artifacts, and the ability to visualize complex
physical processes in a way that made the underlying principles clear.
In Numerical Analysis, I implemented noise reduction for grayscale
images using discrete Fourier transforms, developing algorithms to
identify and eliminate high-frequency components while preserving the
underlying signal. In my Data Management and Machine Learning course, I
explored the unconventional idea of replacing dictionary hash functions
with neural networks to reduce collisions—an approach that required
understanding both the computer science fundamentals of data structures
and the deep learning techniques necessary to train effective models.
These projects taught me to approach problems from first principles, to
implement solutions efficiently, and to validate that my implementations
actually worked as intended.

Looking back at my undergraduate years, I recognize that my academic
record—a 3.28 GPA—doesn't fully reflect my capabilities, and I want to
address this directly. I struggled with focus and study habits during
those years, problems that stemmed partly from graduating high school
during COVID and developing poor attendance patterns that followed me
into college. I often skipped lectures, didn't allocate sufficient time
for homework, and underestimated the difficulty of upper-level
mathematics and physics courses. My approach was to explore everything
that interested me—hence the two degrees, the minor, the three research
labs, and the multiple engineering clubs—rather than to optimize my
performance in any single area. But the turning point came in Physics V,
a demanding course covering quantum mechanics and electromagnetism,
where I completely revised my study habits and earned an A, including a
perfect score on the quantum mechanics exam. This demonstrated to me
that when I commit fully and apply disciplined study methods, I can
excel at the highest level of undergraduate physics and mathematics.

After graduation, rather than immediately pursuing graduate school, I
made the deliberate choice to join the Peace Corps. I needed
perspective and maturity—I needed to step away from the constant input
of mentors and advisors and discover what truly motivated me when I was
completely on my own. For the past eighteen months, I've been serving as
a mathematics teacher in Guinea, West Africa, teaching three classes of
over seventy students each—in French, a language I learned here. I've
worked with my principal to end corporal punishment and implement new
discipline policies, and I've pioneered an exercise-focused teaching
approach to replace the rote memorization standard that dominates
education here. This experience has transformed me in ways I couldn't
have anticipated. Teaching 200+ students with minimal resources, in a
language I didn't speak fluently when I arrived, in a culture completely
different from my own, has taught me adaptability, resourcefulness, and
the ability to build systems from first principles. It's proven to me
that I can commit to difficult, long-term goals and see them through
even when the challenges seem overwhelming.

More importantly, the distance and perspective of Peace Corps service
allowed me to finally identify what I want to dedicate my career to.
During my undergraduate years, I seriously considered pursuing a physics
PhD until conversations with researchers revealed aspects of academic
culture that troubled me—the publish-or-perish pressure, the emphasis on
career advancement over genuine intellectual exploration, the narrow
specialization required to be competitive. I briefly considered data
engineering for the financial security it offered, but I knew I couldn't
sustain passion for work that felt fundamentally dry. I needed to find
something that could hold my complete attention, something that
synthesized my interests in physics, mathematics, and artificial
intelligence while creating something tangible and meaningful.

That's when I discovered the field of agile autonomous systems, and
everything suddenly made sense. I came across research from groups like
ETH Zurich's Robotics and Perception Group, watching their demonstrations
of drones navigating complex environments with animal-like agility, and I
felt something click into place. Here was a field where the mathematical
elegance of control theory, the empirical depth of physics, and the
creative power of machine learning converged to create systems that
moved through the world with a kind of intelligence that felt genuinely
alive. The specific technical challenges—vision-based learning,
perception algorithms that enable real-time navigation through
unstructured environments, reinforcement learning and differentiable
simulation for training sensorimotor policies, the sim-to-real transfer
problem—felt like exactly the kind of problems I wanted to spend my
career solving. I realized I had finally found work I could commit to
completely, where I could focus one hundred percent of my energy without
distraction or doubt.

Since that realization, I've been aggressively building my knowledge
base in robotics. I'm currently working through Russ Tedrake's
Underactuated Robotics course from MIT and Steven Brunton's Data-Driven
Engineering materials, absorbing the fundamental concepts of robotic
control, state estimation, and model-based learning. To demonstrate my
understanding and commitment, I'm developing a comprehensive web-based
tutorial that explains cart-pole balancing through multiple
complementary approaches: PID control, LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator),
reinforcement learning, neural network policies, and trajectory
optimization. Each method is accompanied by interactive simulations
built with PyDrake, with all the mathematical theory explained alongside
working implementations. The goal is to show not just that I can
implement these algorithms, but that I understand them deeply enough to
teach them to others, to explain why each approach works, where it
fails, and how the different methods relate to each other. I'm also
planning to complete a comprehensive C++ course and build several
robotics projects in that language before beginning graduate studies,
recognizing that high-performance robotics systems require proficiency
in compiled languages for real-time control and sensor processing.

My technical skills now span the full stack necessary for robotics
research: strong foundations in Python and MATLAB for rapid prototyping
and scientific computing, growing proficiency in C++ for performance-critical
implementations, experience with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch
for perception and learning systems, familiarity with ROS for robot
software architecture, and solid grounding in numerical optimization,
computer vision, and state estimation. My background in physics gives me
an intuitive understanding of dynamics and control, my mathematics
training provides the theoretical tools for rigorous analysis, and my
computer science work has taught me how to implement efficient, reliable
software systems.

What drives me now is a clear vision of the work I want to do. I'm
fascinated by the challenge of enabling robots to perceive and navigate
dynamically through unstructured environments—the problem of taking raw
sensory input, whether vision or other modalities, and mapping it in
real-time to control commands that allow a robot to move with speed,
precision, and adaptability. I want to work on vision-based robot
learning with foundation models, exploring how we can leverage the
recent breakthroughs in large-scale pre-trained models to give robots
more robust, generalizable perception capabilities. I'm interested in
agile flight and legged locomotion, in the specific technical challenges
of making robots move with the fluid efficiency of biological systems. I
want to work on the sim-to-real transfer problem, developing methods
that allow robots to learn behaviors in simulation that transfer
reliably to the physical world. These aren't abstract research
interests—they're the specific technical problems I think about
constantly, the challenges I want to dedicate the next phase of my life
to solving.

I'm preparing now for graduate studies in robotics starting Fall 2026,
targeting programs with strong research groups in perception, learning,
and control for autonomous systems. I bring to this next phase a solid
mathematical and computational foundation, demonstrated research ability
across multiple domains, significant teaching experience that's
developed my communication skills and resilience, and most importantly,
complete commitment to the field of robotics. My undergraduate GPA
reflects a period of unfocused exploration, but my recent trajectory—the
self-directed study, the project development, the maturity gained
through Peace Corps service—demonstrates the focused dedication I will
bring to graduate work. I'm ready to contribute to and learn from a
strong robotics research community, and I'm excited to finally begin the
work I know I'm meant to do.
