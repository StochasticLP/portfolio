          <p>The cart-pole system consists of a cart which can move left and right 
            and a pole wich can freely swing around like a pendulum. In this control
            problem, we are allowed to actuate the wheels of the cart, but not the 
            pole itself. The goal is to balance the pole so that it stands perfectly
            upright while also keeping the cart in the middle of the track.
